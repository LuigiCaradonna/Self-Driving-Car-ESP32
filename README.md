# Self-Driving-Car-ESP32
This is a part of the project I'm trying to realize. The final goal is to build a self driving car with lane recognition, some road signs and traffic light recognition and parking capability.

This repository contains the code required by the microcontroller in use to drive the car, an ESP32. The ESP32 has not the computing power to support computer vision, thus that part will be achieved exchanging data through a WiFi connection with a PC running Python and OpenCV.
